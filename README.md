# Toy-Organ-PCB-design


PCB designed to function as a toy organ for an electronics course 
The circuit uses a 555 timer linked to a dynamic configuration of resistors to produce variable tune
Each of the resistors is a potentiometer, allowing me to tune each note by itself.

## Big thank you to PCBWay for offering to make the PCB board.
Though the design is still not finished yet and the finished product hasn't been made, PCBWay has always been supportive and responsive when it came to this matter!
